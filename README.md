## INTRODUCTION

### 🌐 What Is Web3?
Web3, also known as the decentralized web, represents the next generation of the internet, where users have control over their data and interactions are facilitated directly between parties without the need for intermediaries. Unlike Web2, which is dominated by centralized platforms, Web3 leverages blockchain technology to ensure transparency, security, and decentralization. It encompasses a wide array of technologies and concepts, including cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).

### Celo Foundation’s Role in the Web3 Ecosystem
Celo Foundation is at the forefront of the Web3 revolution, driving the adoption of decentralized finance and promoting financial inclusion worldwide. By leveraging blockchain technology, the foundation is working to create a more equitable and accessible financial system, paving the way for a future where everyone can participate in the global economy.

### 💱 Wallets & Transactions

<b>* What is a wallet</b><br>
  Wallets are tools that create accounts, manage keys, and help users transact on the Celo network.
  It's important to be careful when choosing a wallet because they manage your secret account keys. You should only use reputable wallets that are    well maintained by organizations/people that you trust.
  
<b>* Finding wallet applications</b><br>
  There are currently some compatible wallets for Celo and other EVM compatible networks.<br>

### Celo, Ethereum & The Evm (Ethereum Virtual Machine).

Ethereum is characterised by Turing completeness, as the EVM allows any computation to be performed if adequate resources are provided.
In simple terms  it is able to use its code base to perform virtually any task, as long as it has the correct instructions, enough time and processing power.

Ethereum started as a way to make a general-purpose blockchain that could be programmed for a variety of uses. But very quickly, Ethereum’s vision expanded to become a platform for programming DApps. DApps represent a broader perspective than smart contracts. A DApp is, at the very least, a smart contract and a web user interface. More broadly, a DApp is a web application that is built on top of open, decentralized, peer-to-peer infrastructure services.

In terms of programmability, Celo is similar to Ethereum. Both networks run the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to support smart contract functionality. This means that all programming languages, developer tooling and standards that target the EVM are relevant for both Celo and Ethereum.

A DApp is composed of at least:
* Smart contracts on a blockchain
* A web frontend user interface
  
### 🌐 Common Terms Used In Web3.

* Blockchain (A database maintained by a distributed set of computers that do not share a trust relationship or common ownership. This arrangement     is referred to as decentralized. The content of a blockchain's database, or ledger, is authenticated using cryptographic techniques, preventing     its contents being edited or removed except according to a protocol's consensus mechanism)
  
* Smart Contract (Smart contracts are intructions embeded within code which are executed automatically by a computer program or a transaction          protocol. They make actions such as transferring cryptocurrencies or other tokens possible.)
  
* Transactions (Ethereum transactions are network messages that include (among other things) a sender, recipient, value, and data payload.)
  
* Data Structures (Ethereum’s state is stored locally on each node as a database, which contains the transactions and system state in a serialized     hashed data structure called a Merkle Patricia Tree.)
  
* Gas (A step of execution of a smart contract. Different operations consume different amounts of gas. To prevent denial-of-service attacks,           transactions specify a maximum gas which bounds the steps of execution before a transaction is reverted.)
  
* Blocks (The unit of update to the blockchain. A block consists of a header identifying its position in the chain and other metadata, and a body      that contains a list of transactions, and data structures that describe the new state after executing those transactions.)
  
* Consensus and finality (Ethereum’s consensus rules are defined in the reference specification, the Yellow Paper <a       href="https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf" rel="noreferrer">(see Further Reading)</a>

* Private Key (A private key is a long, randomly generated number that serves as a cryptographic key in blockchain networks. It is used to sign         transactions and prove ownership of blockchain addresses and the assets within them.)
  
* Public Key (A public key is a cryptographic code used to facilitate secure transactions and interactions on a blockchain network. It is derived       from a private key and can be openly shared without compromising the security of the associated assets.)
  
* Node (A node is a computer that runs the Ethereum client software and is connected to other nodes on the network. These nodes work together to       verify transactions )
  
* JSON-RPC (JSON-RPC is used to communicate with the node through a Web3 provider, a software component that exposes a JSON-RPC API to the client     application)
  
* Web3 Provider (Providers take JSON-RPC requests and return the response.)

* Contract ABI ( "ABI" stands for Application Binary Interface in the context of Ethereum smart contracts. It specifies how to interact with a smart contract deployed on the blockchain.)

### Introduction To Solidity.

Solidity is an EVM compatible language which supports a variety of data types that can be categorized mainly into value types and reference types. Other types such as function types and Tuples also exist.

<b>*Value Types</b>-
Boolean, Integers, Fixed Point Numbers, Address, Bytes, String, Enums.

<b>*Reference Types</b>-
Arrays, Structs, Mappings.

<b>*Other Types</b>-
Function types- Can be internal or external (e.g., function (uint) external returns (bool))<br>
Tuples- Group multiple values (e.g., (uint, string, address)).

### 📚 Syntax Explanation

<b>
Inheritance in Solidity allows a contract to use the functions, events, and state variables of another contract. This enables code reuse and modularity. 
</b>

When Ebenezer inherits from ERC20, it means that Ebenezer will have all the functionalities of the ERC20 contract, such as token transfer, balance checking, and allowance handling.

<b>contract Ebenezer:</b>
This declares a new contract named Ebenezer.

<b>is ERC20:</b>
The keyword is indicates that the Ebenezer contract inherits from another contract, in this case, the ERC20 contract.
The imported ERC20 contract is provided by OpenZeppelin that implements the standard ERC20 token functionality.
The syntax constructor() ERC20("Ebenezer", "EBN") is actually shorthand for calling the constructor of the inherited ERC20 contract. Here’s a detailed explanation:

<b>*constructor():</B>
Declares the constructor function of the EbenezerToken contract.

<b>*ERC20("Ebenezer", "EBN"):</b>
Calls the constructor of the parent ERC20 contract, passing in the name and symbol for the token.

In essence, this constructor setup ensures that when the EbenezerToken is deployed, it is properly initialized as an ERC20 token with the specified name and symbol, and it also creates the initial token supply.

The line <b>_mint(msg.sender, 100000 * 10 ** decimals())</b> in an ERC20 contract mints new tokens and assigns them to the deployer's address. Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

<b>_mint:</b> 
This function is an internal function provided by OpenZeppelin's ERC20 contract. It creates new tokens and assigns them to a specified address, increasing the total supply of tokens.

<b>msg.sender:</b>
This is a global variable in Solidity that refers to the address that is currently calling the function. In the context of a constructor, msg.sender is the address that deployed the contract.

<b>10000 * 10 ** decimals():</b> This calculates the number of tokens to be minted, taking into account the token's decimal places. Here's how this calculation works:

<b>decimals()</b> is a function in the ERC20 contract that returns the number of decimal places the token uses, typically 18 for most ERC20 tokens.

<b>10 ** decimals()</b> calculates 10 to the power of the number of decimals, which in the case of 18 decimals would be 10^18.

<b>10000 * 10 ** decimals()</b> then multiplies 10,000 by 10^18 to get the total number of smallest units (often called "wei" in the context of ERC20 tokens) for 10,000 tokens.

### 🔧 Compile the Contract
With the contract above as the active tab in the Editor, compile the contract.
A quick way to compile is to hit ctrl + s. You can also compile by going to the Solidity compiler and clicking the compile button, or by right clicking a file in the File Explorer, or by clicking the play button at the top of the Editor.

### 🚀 Deploying the contract
Go to the Deploy & Run Transactions plugin at the sidebar section.
At the top of this plugin is the Environment select box. Here you choose Injected Provider which is used to connect Remix with a Browser Wallet (e.g. Metamask) which is generally for deploying to a public network.
Make sure you have switched your wallet network to Celo's Alfajores Testnet. Deploy your contract and approve the contract creation transaction from the MetaMask pop-up then wait for the confirmation pop-up.
With the deployment done, we can go ahead and verify the smart contract too.
