<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Celo Composer allows you to quickly build, deploy, and iterate on decentralized applications using Celo. It provides a number of frameworks, examples, and Celo specific functionality to help you get started with your next dApp.

## Built With

Celo Composer is built on Celo to make it simple to build dApps using a variety of front-end frameworks, and libraries.

- [Celo](https://celo.org/)
- [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.19/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [viem](https://viem.sh/)
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Prerequisites

- Node (v20 or higher)
- Git (v2.38 or higher)

## How to use Celo Composer

The easiest way to start with Celo Composer is using `@celo/celo-composer`. This CLI tool lets you quickly start building dApps on Celo for multiple frameworks, including React (with either react-celo or rainbowkit-celo), React Native (w/o Expo), Flutter, and Angular. To get started, just run the following command, and follow the steps:

- Step 1

```bash
npx @celo/celo-composer@latest create
```

- Step 2: Provide the Project Name: You will be prompted to enter the name of your project.

```text
What is your project name: 
```

- Step 3: Choose to Use Hardhat: You will be asked if you want to use Hardhat. Select Yes or No.

```text
Do you want to use Hardhat? (Y/n)
```

- Step 4: Choose to Use a Template: You will be asked if you want to use a template. Select `Yes` or `No`.

```text
Do you want to use a template?
```

- Step 5: Select a Template: If you chose to use a template, you will be prompted to select a template from the list provided.

```text
- Minipay
- Valora
- Social Connect
```

- Step 6: Provide the Project Owner's Name: You will be asked to enter the project owner's name.

```text
Project Owner name:
```

- Step 7: Wait for Project Creation: The CLI will now create the project based on your inputs. This may take a few minutes.

- Step 8: Follow the instructions to start the project. The same will be displayed on the console after the project is created.

```text
🚀 Your starter project has been successfully created!

Before you start the project, please follow these steps:

1. Rename the file:
   packages/react-app/.env.template
   to
   packages/react-app/.env

2. Open the newly renamed .env file and add all the required environment variables.

Once you've done that, you're all set to start your project!

Run the following commands from the packages/react-app folder to start the project:

   yarn install
   yarn dev

If you prefer npm, you can run:

   npm install
   npm run dev
